# Get_next_line

This is a project from the first circle of the 42cursus.

### Objectives
  * Code a function that reads a file with a certain size given (bytes to read) until finding a line and returns it using only one static variable.
  * For the bonus part it should manage multiple files.

### Allowed functions
  * read
  * malloc
  * free

### What I've learnt from this project
  * Problem solving
  * Unix logic
  * Management of memory leaks

### How to use
  * Compile the files using the -D option and give BUFFER_SIZE (bytes to read) a value. Example (gcc *.c -D BUFFER_SIZE='size')
